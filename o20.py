Problem:
Write a program to print whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not..
(Armstrong number is a number in which all the sum of cubes of digits is equal to the number

Example:-
Input
n=153

Output
true

Logic - 153 is an Armstrong number because 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 +125 + 27 = 153 which is equal to the original number )

Input
123

Output
false

Logic - 123 is not an Armstrong number because 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 8 + 27 = 36 which is not equal to the original number )
